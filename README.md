# Asteroids->Asteroids Harvester

Course work for Game Design Practicum taught by Stephen Lane,
Modification of my retro Astroids (https://github.com/WindyDarian/UnityAsteroids) to have different goals and rules so it offers different experience, made with Unity

## New rules:
1. When player press Shift, a gravity cannon is fired; which can give asteroids an impulse towards player location
2. Moving medium or small asteroids to center will harvest it and give a major score bonus
New resource:
3. Playerâ€™s physical bullet has become a resource to introduce the gravity cannon, player needs to pick up after fired


## Score system:
* Destroying asteroids will give little score, now player needs to move and harvest asteroids in order to get large bonus
